## Overview
Lists entities in the current chunk.

Useful for locating entities that you know are in a chunk, but cannot be seen.

## Usage
A player with operator privileges runs `/listentities` in-game.

The user may optionally provide a limit; `/listentities 50` will list 50 entities in the current chunk.
